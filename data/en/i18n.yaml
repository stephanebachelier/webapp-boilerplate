view.about.second.title: "Why ?"
view.about.why.section: "Yeoman generators are great but IMHO not sufficient for an everyday developer. When you're building lots of SPA you're already doing the same things to setup a project. There are a lots of generators on the wild so I decided to create this boilerplate."

view.about.third.title: "What's inside"
view.about.inside.section: "This boilerplate is built on top of `yeoman` to create SPA while using Backbone.Marionette. It was started by using `generator-backbone`."
view.about.inside.list: |
  <li>`yo`: Yeoman of course!</li>
  <li>`grunt`: the famous javascript task runner</li>
  <li>`bower`: the front-end package manager</li>
  <li>`Backbone.Marionette` and its dependencies: `Backbone.Wreqr`, `Backbone.BabySitter`</li>
  <li>`Backbone.Syphon`: to serialize form as objects</li>
  <li>`validate.js`: to validate forms using its matching expressions</li>
  <li>`fastclick`: to remove ~300ms delay on click (mobile)</li>
